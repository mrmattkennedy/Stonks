3 modules to this
	Scraper pulls data
	Analyzer looks at data pulled, makes decisions
	Visualizer...visualizes. Not working real time.

Flow:
Scraper pulls, then wakes up analyzer
	Pros to waking up/maintaing process:
		Can just record delta vs recording entire DB every time used

Starts at driver. 
Driver has GUI
Runs iterations of scraper
Calls analyzer when scraper done after each iteration
Can also run visualizer
